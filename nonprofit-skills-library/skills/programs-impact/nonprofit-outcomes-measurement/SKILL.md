description: "Designs KPIs, indicators, and evaluation plans for nonprofit programs, selects data collection methods and instruments, and structures outcomes reporting to funders and the board. Use when a user asks to define what to measure for a program, build an outcomes/evaluation plan or measurement framework, choose between pre/post surveys vs. administrative data vs. validated scales, set up a data collection calendar or dashboard, calculate outcome or completion rates, write the outcomes/results section of a funder or annual report, or figure out why current metrics don't show real impact. Covers measuring and reporting whether a program's stated outcomes actually occurred, not designing the logic model those outcomes came from (nonprofit-program-design) and not the community research that justifies starting a program (nonprofit-needs-assessment)."

# Nonprofit Outcomes Measurement

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for the measurement and evaluation side of program work — turning a program's
intended outcomes into something you can actually track, collect data on, and report. Concrete
triggers:

- "What KPIs should we track for this program?"
- "We need an evaluation plan for our funder / accreditor."
- "Should we use a survey, a validated scale, or just count completions?"
- "Build a data collection calendar / outcomes dashboard."
- "Write the results section of our annual report / grant report."
- "Our numbers look fine but I don't think we're actually creating change — what are we missing?"
- "How do we calculate our program's outcome/retention/completion rate?"

**Boundary — read before starting:**
- Building the logic model or theory of change that defines *what* the outcomes should be is
  `nonprofit-program-design`. This skill starts from an existing (or roughly sketched) outcomes
  column and builds the measurement plan under it.
- Community-level research to justify whether a program should exist at all is
  `nonprofit-needs-assessment` — that's pre-program; this skill is mid-to-post-program.
- Writing the outcomes section into a specific grant *proposal's* narrative voice is
  `nonprofit-grant-writing`; this skill produces the underlying data, plan, and results that get fed
  into that narrative (and into `nonprofit-annual-report`).

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Indicators vs. Outcomes vs. Outputs

- **Outcome**: the change stated in the logic model (e.g., "increased housing stability").
- **Indicator**: the specific, measurable proxy for that outcome (e.g., "% of participants still
  housed at 6-month follow-up"). One outcome often needs 1–3 indicators to be credible.
- **Output**: a count of activity (e.g., "number of case management sessions delivered") — tracked
  for accountability, not as evidence of change. Do not let output counts stand in for outcome data
  in a report; this is the most common credibility gap funders flag.

### 2. SMART and CREAM Indicator Tests

Screen every candidate indicator against:
- **SMART**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
- **CREAM** (an evaluation-specific add-on, useful for indicator selection specifically):
  Clear, Relevant, Economic (affordable to collect), Adequate (sufficiently captures the outcome),
  Monitorable (data is actually obtainable on a regular cycle).

### 3. Evaluation Design Types (name the design explicitly in any plan)

- **Pre/post design** — same measure before and after the intervention on the same participants;
  the default for most direct-service nonprofits given cost constraints.
- **Comparison group design** — treatment vs. a similar but unserved group; stronger evidence,
  rarely feasible without a research partner or funder mandate.
- **Randomized controlled trial (RCT)** — gold standard for attribution; almost never appropriate to
  recommend for a typical nonprofit's internal evaluation — flag as a research-partnership question,
  not a default.
- **Pre-experimental / single-group post-only** — weakest design (measuring only after, no
  baseline); acceptable only for pilot or output-level reporting, say so explicitly if this is what
  a client is doing.
- **Developmental/formative evaluation** — used for new or still-evolving programs to improve design
  in real time, distinct from summative evaluation used to judge whether a mature program achieved
  its outcomes. Naming the wrong one to a funder is a routine credibility error.

### 4. Data Collection Method Menu (match method to indicator type)

| Method | Best for | Watch-outs |
|---|---|---|
| Administrative/program data (attendance, case notes, enrollment) | Outputs, completion/retention rates | Only as good as staff data-entry discipline |
| Pre/post surveys (self-report) | Knowledge, attitude, confidence shifts | Social desirability bias; use anonymous IDs where possible |
| Validated scales (e.g., PHQ-9, Rosenberg Self-Esteem, WHO-5, Devereux protective factors scales) | Standardized psychosocial outcomes funders/researchers recognize | Licensing/permission requirements; must be used as validated, not edited |
| Follow-up interviews/focus groups | Depth, unanticipated outcomes, qualitative context | Time-intensive; needs a coding plan, not just anecdotes |
| Administrative record matching (school, employment, court records) | Objective long-term outcomes (graduation, employment, recidivism) | Data-sharing agreements, privacy/consent requirements |
| Direct/skills-based assessment or observation | Skill acquisition (literacy, job skills) | Rater consistency; needs a rubric |

## Instructions

1. **Start from the logic model's outcome column** (request it if it doesn't exist — flag that
   `nonprofit-program-design` should run first if there is no outcomes chain to measure against).
2. **Draft 1–3 indicators per outcome**, screened against SMART/CREAM. Reject indicators that are
   only "nice to know" and don't map to a stated outcome.
3. **Set a baseline and target for each indicator** — a percentage or count with a timeframe (e.g.,
   "70% of participants employed at 90 days, up from a 45% historical baseline"). An indicator with
   no target is not yet actionable.
4. **Name the evaluation design** (pre/post, comparison, developmental, etc.) explicitly and match it
   to what the organization can realistically resource — do not recommend a comparison-group or RCT
   design without confirming budget, timeline, and a research partner.
5. **Select the data collection method per indicator** using the method menu above; check for
   existing validated instruments before building a custom survey from scratch.
6. **Build the collection calendar**: who collects what, at what touchpoint (intake, midpoint, exit,
   follow-up), using what tool (paper form, CRM field, survey platform), and who owns data entry.
7. **Set a response-rate/completion floor** for follow-up data collection up front (e.g., "we need
   ≥60% follow-up response to consider this data reportable") — this prevents cherry-picked
   retrospective spin on incomplete data later.
8. **Calculate rates correctly and show the denominator**: define whether an "outcome rate" is of
   all enrolled, all completers, or all with follow-up data — and report the definition every time,
   not just the number. Denominator-shopping (quietly narrowing the denominator to inflate a rate)
   is a common and damaging error.
9. **Build the reporting layer last**: a one-page dashboard/scorecard for the board (indicators,
   targets, actuals, trend), and a narrative results section for funders that states the evaluation
   design, sample size, response rate, and limitations alongside the results.
10. **Report limitations honestly** — sample size, attribution caveats, selection bias in who
    responded to follow-up. Funders and evaluators trust programs more, not less, when limitations are
    named.

## Common Failure Modes

- **Reporting outputs as if they were outcomes** ("we served 500 people" presented as evidence of
  impact) — the single most common gap that erodes funder trust.
- **No baseline** — an outcome number reported with nothing to compare it to is unreadable evidence.
- **Denominator-shopping** — silently switching which group the percentage is calculated against
  between reporting periods to make results look better.
- **Vanity metrics** — tracking what's easy to count (likes, attendance) instead of what indicates
  real change, because it wasn't screened against CREAM's "adequate" test.
- **Survey fatigue / low follow-up response** — collecting data at exit but not at a meaningful
  follow-up interval, or follow-up response rates so low the data isn't credible (and not disclosing
  the rate).
- **Overclaiming attribution** — presenting pre/post change as caused by the program alone with no
  acknowledgment of external factors, when the design can't support that causal claim.
- **Building the dashboard before the indicators are validated** — locking in a reporting template
  around metrics that later turn out not to map to any real outcome.

## For Advisors/Consultants

- When engaging with a client, separate the conversation into two explicit deliverables so scope and
  fee don't get muddled: (1) an evaluation/measurement plan (indicators, design, methods, calendar),
  and (2) actual data analysis/reporting once data exists — these are frequently sold and staffed as
  two different engagements.
- Push back explicitly if a client's board or ED wants an RCT or comparison-group design "to prove
  impact to funders" without the budget or sample size to support it — recommend a well-documented
  pre/post design with named limitations instead; overpromising evaluation rigor is a common advisor
  failure mode that damages client credibility with funders later.
- Frame the indicator-target-setting conversation (Step 3) as a board-level or leadership
  conversation, not a data-team decision alone — targets carry political weight (a missed target
  becomes a funder or board conversation) and leadership needs to own them.
- Standard advisory deliverable: an evaluation plan document (indicators, design, methods, data
  collection calendar, reporting cadence) plus, if in scope, a results memo mapped to a
  funder-report-ready outcomes section for `nonprofit-grant-writing` or `nonprofit-annual-report` to
  consume.

## Standard Deliverables

- Indicator/KPI table: outcome → indicator(s) → baseline → target → data source → collection cadence
- Named evaluation design with stated limitations
- Data collection calendar and instrument list (including any validated scales used, with citation)
- Board scorecard/dashboard (one page: indicator, target, actual, trend)
- Funder-ready outcomes results narrative, stating sample size, response rate, and denominator
